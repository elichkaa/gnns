/opt/bwhpc/common/jupyter/ai/2025-08-05/lib/python3.11/site-packages/lightning_fabric/plugins/environments/slurm.py:204: The `srun` command is available on your system but is not used. HINT: If your intention is to run Lightning on SLURM, prepend your python command with `srun` like so: srun python train.py --model_type cdgm --encoder_name google/emb ...
💡 Tip: For seamless cloud uploads and versioning, try installing [litmodels](https://pypi.org/project/litmodels/) to enable LitModelCheckpoint, which syncs automatically with the Lightning model registry.

You are using a CUDA device ('NVIDIA A100-PCIE-40GB') that has Tensor Cores. To properly utilize them, you should set `torch.set_float32_matmul_precision('medium' | 'high')` which will trade-off precision for performance. For more details, read https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.set_float32_matmul_precision.html#torch.set_float32_matmul_precision
